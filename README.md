This repository demonstrates a common SQL error stemming from data type mismatches and implicit type conversions. The `bug.sql` file contains a query that leads to unexpected behavior or errors due to incompatible data types. The `bugSolution.sql` file provides a corrected version with explicit type casting and careful data type handling to prevent errors and ensure accurate query results.
