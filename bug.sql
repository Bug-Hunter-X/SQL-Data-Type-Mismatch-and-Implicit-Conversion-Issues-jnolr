The SQL query might encounter an error if there are inconsistent data types in the columns being compared or used in calculations. For example, attempting to compare a numeric column with a string column without explicit type casting can lead to unexpected results or errors.  Another issue arises when using functions that expect a specific data type but are provided with a different one. This can result in runtime errors or inaccurate results.  Finally, if the query involves joining tables with columns of incompatible data types, it might fail to produce accurate results or throw an error.
