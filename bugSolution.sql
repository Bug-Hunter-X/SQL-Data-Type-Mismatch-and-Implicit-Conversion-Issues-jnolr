To address the data type mismatch errors, explicit type casting should be used to convert data to the expected type before any comparisons or calculations.  For instance, if comparing a numeric column (`numeric_column`) with a string column (`string_column`) that might contain numeric values, explicitly cast the string column to a numeric type:  `WHERE numeric_column = CAST(string_column AS INT)`.  Additionally, always verify data types before using functions and ensure consistency during table joins. Using `CASE` statements can handle potential type conversion issues in a more controlled manner. For example: `CASE WHEN ISNUMERIC(string_column) = 1 THEN CAST(string_column AS INT) ELSE NULL END` This prevents errors when non-numeric values are present. By carefully managing data types and using explicit type conversion, data integrity and query accuracy are ensured.
